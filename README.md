A event-driven framework for writing reliable and scalable system.

At a high level, it provides a few major components:

* Tools for [core components with traits][ruva-core],
* [Macros][ruva-macro] for processing events and commands

# A Tour of Ruva

Ruva consists of a number of modules that provide a range of functionality
essential for implementing messagebus-like applications in Rust. In this
section, we will take a brief tour, summarizing the major APIs and
their uses.

## Command & Event
You can register any general struct with [Command] Derive Macro as follows:
```rust
#[derive(Command)]
pub struct MakeOrder {
    pub user_id: i64,
    pub items: Vec<String>,
}
```
As you attach [Command] derive macro, MessageBus now is going to be able to understand how and where it should
dispatch the command to.

Likewise, you can do the same thing for Event:
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Message)]
#[internally_notifiable]
pub struct OrderFailed {
    #[identifier]
    pub user_id: i64,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Message)]
#[internally_notifiable]
pub struct OrderSucceeded{
    #[identifier]
    pub user_id: i64,
    pub items: Vec<String>
}
```
Note that use of `internally_notifiable`(or `externally_notifiable`) and `identifier` is MUST.

* `internally_notifiable` is marker to let the system know that the event should be handled
within the application
* `externally_notifiable` is to leave `OutBox`.
* `identifier` is to record aggregate id.

## Initializing Command Handlers
Command handlers are responsible for handling commands in an application, the response of which is sent directly to
clients. Commands are imperative in nature, meaning they specify what should be done.

```rust
use ruva::prelude::{init_command_handler, init_event_handler};


init_command_handler!(
{
   MakeOrder: OrderHandler::make_order,
   CancelOrder: OrderHandler::cancel_order
}
);
```
In the example above, you see `MakeOrder` is mapped to `OrderHandler::make_order`, handler in application layer.

At this point, imagine you want to handle both success/failure case of the `MakeOrder` command processing.
Then you have to think about using event handlers.  

## Registering Event

`Event` is a side effect of [Command] or yet another [Event] processing.
You can register as many handlers as possible as long as they all consume same type of Event as follows:

### Example

```rust
init_event_handler!(
{
   OrderFaild: [
           NotificationHandler::send_mail,
           ],
   OrderSucceeded: [
           DeliveryHandler::checkout_delivery_items,
           InventoryHandler::change_inventory_count
           ]
}
);
```
In the `MakeOrder` Command Handling, we have either `OrderFailed` or `OrderSucceeded` event with their own processing handlers.
Events are raised in the handlers that are thrown to [MessageBus] by [Context].
[MessageBus] then loops through the handlers UNLESS `StopSentinel` is received.

## Handler API Example

Handlers can be located anywhere as long as they accept two argument:

* msg - either [Command] or [Event]
* context - [AtomicContextManager]

### Example
```rust
pub async fn make_order(
    cmd: MakeOrder,
    context: AtomicContextManager,
) -> Result<ServiceResponse, ServiceError> {
    let mut uow = UnitOfWork::<Repository<OrderAggregate>, SQLExecutor>::new(context).await;

    let mut order_aggregate = OrderAggregate::new(cmd);
    uow.repository().add(&mut task_aggregate).await?;

    uow.commit::<ServiceOutBox>().await?;

    Ok(().into())
}

```
But sometimes, you may want to add yet another dependencies. For that, Dependency Injection mechanism has been implemented.
So, you can also do something along the lines of:

```rust
pub async fn make_order(
    cmd: MakeOrder,
    context: AtomicContextManager,
    payment_gateway_caller: Box<dyn Fn(String, Value) -> Future<(), ServiceError> + Send + Sync + 'static> //injected dependency
) -> Result<ServiceResponse, ServiceError> {
    let mut uow = UnitOfWork::<Repository<OrderAggregate>, SQLExecutor>::new(context).await;

    let mut order_aggregate = OrderAggregate::new(cmd,payment_gateway_caller);
    uow.repository().add(&mut task_aggregate).await?;

    uow.commit::<ServiceOutBox>().await?;

    Ok(().into())
}
```

How is this possible? because we preprocess handlers so it can allow for `DI container`.

## Dependency Injection
You can simply register dependencies by putting attribute on top of free function.

### Example

```rust
#[dependency]
pub fn payment_gateway_caller() -> Box<dyn Fn(String, Value) -> Future<(), ServiceError> + Send + Sync + 'static> {
    if cfg!(test) {
        __test_payment_gateway_caller()  //Dependency For Test
    } else {
        __actual_payment_gateway_caller() //Real Dependency
    }
}

```

This is great as you can take your mind off static nature of the language.

## MessageBus
At the core is event driven library is [MessageBus], which gets command and gets raised event from
`UnitOfWork` and dispatch the event to the right handlers.
As this is done only in framework side, the only way you can 'feel' the presence of messagebus is
when you invoke it. Everything else is done magically.

### Example
```rust
#[derive(Command)]
pub struct MakeOrder { // Test Command
    pub user_id: i64,
    pub items: Vec<String>
}

async fn test_func(){
    let bus = MessageBus::new(command_handler(), event_handler())
    let command = MakeOrder{user_id:1, items:vec!["shirts","jeans"]}
    match bus.handle(command).await{
        Err(err)=> { // test for error case }
        Ok(val)=> { // test for happy case }
    }
    }
    }   
}
```

#### Error from MessageBus
When command has not yet been regitered, it returns an error - `BaseError::NotFound`
Be mindful that bus does NOT return the result of event processing as in distributed event processing.
